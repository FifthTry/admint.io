tagline: **WHY NFTs?**

NFTs started out cool. And then people started pserceiving them to be nothing
more than overpriced jpegs. That's simply not true. They can be so much more!
The way a jar could be filled with cookies, candies, pickled stuff or have
coins in them, it is up to us what value an NFT should have in them. Think of
NFTs to be a container that depending on what's inside them, can change the
experience for the NFT owner. Let's get to know NFTs better.

The other side of the coin really! If something can store value, that value can
be extended to provide real-world utility. Imagine creating a bunch of extended
value-adds around the statement, “if a user has a particular NFT then, allow
them to...”

associations like “if user has NFT X, drop NFT Y in to their wallet. This makes
NFTs highly flexible as a tradeable asset.

into one or break down an NFT into smaller components. Makes for interesting
evolutionary models to be built using NFTs.
